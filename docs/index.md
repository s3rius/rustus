Rustus is a [TUS](https://tus.io) protocol implementation that helps you handle file uploads.

This project has many features that makes it easy to integrate with your application.


## Installation

You can install rustus in four different ways.

### From source

To build it from source rust must be installed.
Preferred version is 1.59.0.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s3rius/rustus.git
cd rustus
cargo install --path . --features=all
```

Also, you can speedup build by disabling some features.

Available features:

* `amqp_notifier` - adds `AMQP` protocol support for notifying about upload status;
* `db_info_storage` - adds support for storing information about upload in different databases (`Postgres`, `MySQL`, `SQLite`);
* `http_notifier` - adds support for notifying about upload status via `HTTP` protocol;
* `redis_info_storage` - adds support for storing information about upload in `Redis` database;
* `hashers` - adds support for checksum verification;
* `all` - enables all Rustus features.

All precompiled binaries have all features enabled.

### With cargo

If you have cargo installed, it might be easier to
install it directly from crates.io.

```bash
cargo install rustus --features=all
```

### Binaries

All precompiled binaries available on Github releases page.
You can download binaries from [here](https://github.com/s3rius/rustus/releases), unpack it and run.

```bash

```

Make sure you download right version for your CPU architecture and OS.

### Using Docker

Alpine based images are more lightweight than Debian

```
